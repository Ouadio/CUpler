# CUpler : A kinematic modeling of planets motion using CUDA 
## Overview  
Celestial mechanics, which is the branch of astronomy that studies the motions of objects such as stars and planets in outer space, was first introduced by *Johannes Kepler (1571â€“1630)* whose work led to the modern laws of planetary orbits.  
The resulting formulations made by Kepler describe the kinematics of moving objects without consideration of the motion causes *(forces and interactions)*, introduced later by *Isaac Newton* in 1687.     

The present project implements the basic orbital motion formulations in a GPGPU fashion using CUDA, along with practical use cases like trajectory and relative positions computations based on initial observations.
